## Question 1

**How do we interpret the parameter estimates in this output? Specifically, how do these parameter estimates relate to the group means?**

### Answer: 
The SAS codes are as follows:

The parameter estimates and group means are as follows:

The parameter estimates in these outputs are the differences between the group estimated means and the reference group estimated mean. The reference group is the `Drug G` group.\
The parameter estimate for `Intercept` is 62.1, which means the estimated mean of the `Drug G` group is 62.1.\
The parameter estimate for the `Drug A` group is -37.8, which means the estimated mean of the `Drug A` group is 37.8 lower than the estimated mean of the `Drug G` group. $\hat{\mu}_{\text{A}} - \hat{\mu}_{\text{G}} = 24.3 - 62.1 = -37.8$.\
The parameter estimate for the `Drug D` group is -20.9, which means the estimated mean of the `Drug D` group is 20.9 lower than the estimated mean of the `Drug G` group. $\hat{\mu}_{\text{D}} - \hat{\mu}_{\text{G}} = 41.2 - 62.1 = -20.9$.\
The parameter estimate for the `Drug G` group is 0, because the reference group is `Drug G`. $\hat{\mu}_{\text{G}} - \hat{\mu}_{\text{G}} = 62.1 - 62.1 = 0$.\

## Question 2

**Where in the plots do you see evidence of violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption?**

### Answer:


## Question 3

**Write code and estimate the pairwise contrasts between the youngest age group and each other age group. Use an appropriate method to control for multiple comparisons.**

### Answer:




## Question 4

**Use orthogonal polynomial contrasts to test for a linear, quadratic and cubic trend. What do you conclude?**

### Answer:



## Question 5

**Remove the last (oldest) group so that there are now 4 age groups. Determine the appropriate orthogonal polynomial contrasts to test for a linear and quadratic trend with 4 groups. Test the contrasts. What do you conclude?**
