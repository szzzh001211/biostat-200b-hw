## Question A.1

**How do we interpret the coefs of the interaction terms? Compare these parameter estimates to those from the separate models.**

### Answer:
The SAS codes are as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.36.55.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.36.37.png" width="80%"/>
</p>

The parameter estimates for the model containing interaction terms are as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.37.19.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
The fitted model is
\begin{align*}
\hat{risk}&=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regnc}}regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regs}}regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regw}}regw+\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}length+\\
&\quad \hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}nclength+\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}slength+\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}wlength\\
&=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regnc}}regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regs}}regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regw}}regw+\\
&\quad (\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}regw)length
\end{align*}


Coefficient for `nclength` = 0.30337, which means that for every one increase in 
average length of stay of all patients in hospital (in days), the increase in estimated mean `risk` 
in the North Central region will be 0.30337 percents more than that in the reference region (North East). 

Coefficient for `slength` = 0.43930, which means that for every one increase in 
average length of stay of all patients in hospital (in days), the increase in estimated mean `risk` 
in the South region will be 0.43930 percents more than that in the reference region (North East). 

Coefficient for `wlength` = -0.29237, which means that for every one increase in 
average length of stay of all patients in hospital (in days), the increase in estimated mean `risk` 
in the West region will be 0.29237 percents less than that in the reference region (North East).

The parameter estimates for the separate models are as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.37.43.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
The coefficients in the separate model region 2 for `length` is 0.60893, which is equal to the coefficient for the interaction 
terms `nclength` in the original model, 0.30337, plus the coefficient for `length` in the original model, 0.30556.\
The intercept in the separate model region 2 for `length` is -1.50280, which is equal to the intercept in the original model, 1.47235, plus the coefficient for `regnc`, -2.97515.\
$\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}' = \hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}} + \hat{\beta}_{\text{length}} = 0.30337 + 0.30556 = 0.60893$
$\hat{\beta_0}' = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta}_{\text{regnc}} = 1.47235 - 2.97515 = -1.50280$

<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.37.52.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
The coefficients in the separate model region 3 for `length` is 0.74486, which is equal to the coefficient for the interaction 
terms `slength` in the original model, 0.43930, plus the coefficient for `length` in the original model, 0.30556.\
The intercept in the separate model region 3 for `length` is -2.91928, which is equal to the intercept in the original model, 1.47235, plus the coefficient for `regs`, -4.39164.\
$\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}' = \hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}} + \hat{\beta}_{\text{length}} = 0.43930 + 0.30556 = 0.74486$
$\hat{\beta_0}' = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta}_{\text{regs}} = 1.47235 - 4.39164 = -2.91928$

<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.38.01.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
The coefficients in the separate model region 4 for `length` is 0.01319, which is equal to the coefficient for the interaction 
terms `wlength` in the original model, -0.29237, plus the coefficient for `length` in the original model, 0.30556.\
The intercept in the separate model region 4 for `length` is 4.27421, which is equal to the intercept in the original model, 1.47235, plus the coefficient for `regw`, 2.80186.\
$\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}' = \hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}} + \hat{\beta}_{\text{length}} = -0.29237 + 0.30556 = 0.01319$
$\hat{\beta_0}' = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta}_{\text{regw}} = 1.47235 + 2.80186 = 4.27421$

## Question A.2

**How would we test whether the slope coef for hospitals in the North Central region is equal to the slope coef for hospitals in the South region? Run this test.**

### Answer:
The SAS codes and test resutls are as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.42.50.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.43.14.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
For the North Cetnral region, the slope coef for `length` is $\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}$, and for the South region, the slope coef for `length` is $\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}$. Since we want to test whether the slope coef for hospitals in the North Central region is equal to the slope coef for hospitals in the South region, then we only need to test whether $\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}} = \hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}$. Therefore, the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_{\text{nclength}} = \beta_{\text{slength}}$ is tested against the alternative hypothesis $H_1: \beta_{\text{nclength}} \neq \beta_{\text{slength}}$.\
From the F-test, $F(1,105)$, we can see that the p-value is $0.5374>0.05$, so we do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant evidence that the slope coef for hospitals in the North Central region is not equal to the slope coef for hospitals in the South region.

## Question A.3

**How would we test whether the slope coef for hospitals in the West region is equal to the slope coef for hospitals in the North East region? Run this test**

### Answer: 
The SAS codes and test resutls are as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.43.00.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.43.28.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
For the North East region, the slope coef for `length` is $\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}$, i.e. `regnc`=`regs`=`regw`=0, and for the West region, the slope coef for `length` is $\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}$. Since we want to test whether the slope coef for hospitals in the North East region is equal to the slope coef for hospitals in the West region, then we only need to test whether $\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}} = 0$. Therefore, the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_{\text{wlength}} = 0$ is tested against the alternative hypothesis $H_1: \beta_{\text{wlength}} \neq 0$.\
From the F-test, $F(1,105)$, we can see that the p-value is $0.3147>0.05$, so we do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant evidence that the slope coef for hospitals in the North East region is not equal to the slope coef for hospitals in the West region.

## Question A.4

**How do these regression coefficients compare to the previous ones, with length not centered? Interpret each regression coef, including the intercept.**

### Answer:
The SAS codes and parameter estimates for the centered model are as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.45.19.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.45.35.png" width="80%"/>
</p>

Coefficients for `lengthc`, `nclengthc`, `slengthc`, and `wlengthc` are the same as the previous ones. Intercept and coefficients for `regnc`, `regs`, and `regw` change. The fitted model for the centered model is:
\begin{align*}
\hat{risk}&=\hat{\beta_0}'+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regnc}}'regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regs}}'regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regw}}'regw+\\
&\quad (\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}'+\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}'regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}'regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}'regw)(length-\bar{length})\\
&=\hat{\beta_0}'+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regnc}}'regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regs}}'regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regw}}'regw-\\
&\quad (\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}'+\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}'regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}'regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}'regw)\bar{length}+\\
&\quad (\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}'+\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}'regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}'regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}'regw)length\\
&=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regnc}}regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regs}}regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regw}}regw+\\
&\quad (\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}regw)length
\end{align*}

Therefore, 
\begin{align*}
&\hat{\beta_0}'+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regnc}}'regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regs}}'regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regw}}'regw-(\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}'+\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}'regnc+\\
&\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}'regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}'regw)\bar{length}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regnc}}regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regs}}regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{regw}}regw
\end{align*}

Also, 
\begin{align*}
&(\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}'+\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}'regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}'regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}'regw)length=\\
&(\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}regnc+\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}regs+\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}regw)length
\end{align*}

So we have:
\begin{align*}
&\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}'=\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}\\
&\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}'=\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}\\
&\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}'=\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}\\
&\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}'=\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}\\
&\hat{\beta_0}'=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{length}}\bar{length}\\
&\hat{\beta}_{\text{regnc}}'=\hat{\beta}_{\text{regnc}}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{nclength}}\bar{length}\\
&\hat{\beta}_{\text{regs}}'=\hat{\beta}_{\text{regs}}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{slength}}\bar{length}\\
&\hat{\beta}_{\text{regw}}'=\hat{\beta}_{\text{regw}}+\hat{\beta}_{\text{wlength}}\bar{length}
\end{align*}

Coefficient for intercept = 4.42042 = 1.47235+0.30556 $\times$ 9.648 and the interpretation is: when the value of `length` is equal to its mean value, and the values of `regnc`, `regs`, `regw`, `nclengthc`, `slengthc`, and `wlengthc` are all equal to zero, i.e. the reference region, the estimated mean `risk` for the reference region (North East) is 4.42042 percents. However, this is only a meaningful interpretation if x=0 is reasonable.

Coefficient for `lengthc` = 0.30556 and the interpretation is: for every one increase in the `length`, the average length of stay of all patients in hospital (in days), the estimated mean `risk` in reference region (North East) will increase by 0.30556 percents.

Coefficient for `nclengthc` = 0.30337 and the interpretation is: for every one increase in the `length`, the average length of stay of all patients in hospital (in days), the increase in estimated mean `risk` 
in the North Central region will be 0.30337 percents more than that in the reference region (North East). 

Coefficient for `slength` = 0.43930 and the interpretation is: for every one increase in the `length`, the average length of stay of all patients in hospital (in days), the increase in estimated mean `risk` 
in the South region will be 0.43930 percents more than that in the reference region (North East). 

Coefficient for `wlength` = -0.29237 and the interpretation is: for every one increase in the `length`, the average length of stay of all patients in hospital (in days), the increase in estimated mean `risk` 
in the West region will be 0.29237 percents less than that in the reference region (North East).

Coefficient for `regnc` = -0.04825 = -2.97515+ 0.30337 $\times$ 9.648 and the interpretation is: when the value of `length` is equal to its mean value, the estimated 
mean `risk` in the North Central region is 0.04825 less than than that in the reference region (North East).

Coefficient for `regs` = -0.15325= -4.39164+ 0.43930 $\times$ 9.648 and the interpretation is: when the value of `length` is equal to its mean value, the estimated 
mean `risk` in the South region is 0.15325 less than that in the reference region (North East).

Coefficient for `regw` = -0.01893= 2.80186-0.29237 $\times$ 9.648 and the interpretation is: when the value of `length` is equal to its mean value, the estimated 
mean `risk` in the West region is 0.01893 less than that in the reference region (North East).


## Question B.1

**Log transformations**: Fit the following models and provide the parameter estimate output (coefs, SEs, p-values), and interpret the regression coefficient associated with the predictor variable. Also, comment briefly on the model fit (residual) diagnostics as to whether the model appears to be a good fit to the data and whether the assumptions of the model are met.

a. Regress `log10 SpikeIgG` (Y) on `days PSO` (X).\
b. Regress `ln SpikeIgG` (Y) on `days PSO` (X).\
c. Regress `days PSO` on `ln(age)`.

### Answer:
a.  The fitted model is as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 13.28.01.png" width="80%"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 13.28.05.png" width="80%"/>
</p>

The parameter estimate output and the residual diagnostics are as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 13.28.33.png" width="80%"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 13.28.47.png" width="80%"/>
</p>

Interpretation for coefficient of `days PSO`: The effect of a one-unit increase in `days PSO` would be to multiply the estimated mean `Spike IgG` by $10^{-0.00192}=0.996$, i.e., a 0.4% decrease.\
From the plots above, it seems that $E(\epsilon_{i}) = 0$ for all $\textit{i}$ and the residual plot does not show any special pattern. And the error variance are roughly constant across all observations. Also, from QQ plot, all points roughly follow a straight line. So the assumptions of the normal error regression model are approximately met but the model is not a good fit to the data because R-Square ($R^2$) is only 0.04.\

b.  The fitted model is as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 13.28.01.png" width="80%"/>
</p>

<p align="center">

The parameter estimate output and the residual diagnostics are as follows:

</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

Interpretation for coefficient of `days PSO`: The effect of a one-unit increase in `days PSO` would be to multiply the estimated mean `Spike IgG` by $e^{-0.00442}=0.996$, i.e., a 0.4% decrease.\
From the plots above, it seems that $E(\epsilon_{i}) = 0$ for all $\textit{i}$ and the residual plot does not show any special pattern. And the error variance are roughly constant across all observations. Also, from QQ plot, all points roughly follow a straight line. So the assumptions of the normal error regression model are approximately met but the model is not a good fit to the data because R-Square ($R^2$) is only 0.04.\

c.  The fitted model is as follows:
<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">

The parameter estimate output and the residual diagnostics are as follows:

<p align="center">

</p>

Interpretation for coefficient of `ln(age)`: For every 1% increase in `age`, the estimated mean `days PSO` will increase by $0.01*16.13521=0.16$.\
From the plots above, it seems that $E(\epsilon_{i}) = 0$ for all $\textit{i}$ and the residual plot does not show any special pattern. And the error variance are roughly constant across all observations. However, from QQ plot, all points do not follow a straight line and there is a special pattern. So the assumptions of the normal error regression model are not met and the model is not a good fit to the data because R-Square ($R^2$) is only 0.0072.\

## Question B.2

**Log-log model**: Using the covid_immune data, fit and interpret a log(Y)-log(X) model for the relationship between `SpikeIgG` and `SpikeIgA`. This should include doing the following:

a. Produce and examine the distributions of `SpikeIgG` and `SpikeIgA`, on their original scale and after log transformation.\
b. Produce a scatterplot of `SpikeIgG` (y) versus `SpikeIgA` (x) with a loess smooth and the linear model fit.\
c. Interpret the coefficient associated with `log(SpikeIgA)` from the log-log model.\
d. Use residuals to check whether the log-log model is a reasonable fit to the data.

### Answer:
a. 
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 13.28.01.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
The distribution of `SpikeIgG` and `SpikeIgA` on their original scale are as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.04.08.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.04.34.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.04.40.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
The distribution of `SpikeIgG` and `SpikeIgA` is right-skewed.

After log transformation, the distribution of `log(SpikeIgG)` and `log(SpikeIgA)` are as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.04.19.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.04.53.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.05.00.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
The distribution of `log(SpikeIgG)` and `log(SpikeIgA)` is approximately normal.

b. The scatterplot of `SpikeIgG` (y) versus `SpikeIgA` (x) with a loess smooth and the linear model fit is as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-05 10.40.17.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-05 10.40.24.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
It is obvious that $x$ and $y$ values are concentrated in a small-value region. The linear model fit is not good.

c. The fitted model is as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.11.29.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.11.50.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
Interpretation for coefficient of `log(SpikeIgA)`: For every 1% increase in `SpikeIgA`, the estimated mean `SpikeIgG` will increase by 0.47350%.

d. The residual plots are as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 14.11.57.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
From the plots above, it seems that $E(\epsilon_{i}) = 0$ for all $\textit{i}$ and the residual plot does not show any special pattern. And the error variance are roughly constant across all observations. Also, from QQ plot, all points roughly follow a straight line. R-Square ($R^2$) is only 0.2778. So the assumptions of the normal error regression model are approximately met and the log-log model is a reasonable fit to the data.

## Question B.3

**Interaction between a categorical and continuous variable.** For this problem, we will use interactions to explore whether the rate of exponential decay of `SpikeIgG` depends on the individual’s peak disease severity.

a. In the covid_immune dataset, I created a variable `peakDiseaseSeverity` that is coded as 1 = asymptomatic or mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. Determine the sample sizes in each category that have data for both `daysPSO` and `SpikeIgG`.\
b. Fit a model with an interaction between `daysPSO` and peak disease severity. Use asymptomatic/mild as the reference category. The outcome variable should be log-transformed `SpikeIgG`.\
c. Conduct a joint test of whether the two interaction terms are equal to zero (this will be an F test).\
d. Regardless of the conclusion of the test for interaction, obtain point estimates of the half-lives of `SpikeIgG` for each of the 3 disease severity groups.

### Answer:
a. The sample sizes in each category that have data for both `daysPSO` and `SpikeIgG` are as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 22.18.27.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 22.18.37.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
For category 1 = asymptomatic or mild, the sample size is 206. For category 2 = moderate, the sample size is 9. For category 3 = severe, the sample size is 12.

b. The fitted model is as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 22.18.45.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 22.18.54.png" width="80%"/>
</p>

c. The joint test of whether the two interaction terms are equal to zero is as follows:
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 22.18.59.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="./screenshot/截屏2024-02-04 22.19.10.png" width="80%"/>
</p>
Null hypothesis: $H_0: \beta_\text{modays} = \beta_\text{sedays} = 0$; Alternative hypothesis: $H_1:$ At least one of $\beta_\text{modays}$ and $\beta_\text{sedays}$ is not equal to 0.\
From the F-test, $F(2,222)$, we can see that the p-value of the joint test is $0.5511>0.05$, so we do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant evidence that at least one the two interaction terms is not equal to zero.

d. The fitted model is 
\begin{align*}
log(\hat{SpikeIgG}) &= 6.78870 +1.53034 \times dismo +2.52143 \times disse - 0.00489 \times daysPSO + \\
&\quad 0.00096 \times dismo*daysPSO - 0.00734 \times disse*daysPSO \\
&= 6.78870 +1.53034 \times dismo +2.52143 \times disse +\\
&\quad(- 0.00489+ 0.00096 \times dismo- 0.00734 \times disse) * daysPSO
\end{align*}

So when `peakDiseaseSeverity` is 1 = asymptomatic or mild, i.e. `dismo`=`disse`=0, the coefficient of `daysPSO` is -0.00489.\
When `peakDiseaseSeverity` is 2 = moderate, i.e. `dismo`=1, `disse`=0, the coefficient of `daysPSO` is -0.00489+0.00096=-0.00393.\
When `peakDiseaseSeverity` is 3 = severe, i.e. `dismo`=0, `disse`=1, the coefficient of `daysPSO` is -0.00489-0.00734=-0.01223.\
Since the point estimates of the half-lives of `SpikeIgG` is $t_{1/2}=\frac{\mathrm{ln}2}{-\beta}$, where $\beta$ is the coefficient of `daysPSO`, then the point estimates of the half-lives of `SpikeIgG` for each of the 3 disease severity groups are as follows:

- For category 1 = asymptomatic or mild, the point estimate of the half-life is $t_{1/2}=\frac{\mathrm{ln}2}{0.00489}=141.7$ days.

- For category 2 = moderate, the point estimate of the half-life is $t_{1/2}=\frac{\mathrm{ln}2}{0.00393}=176.4$ days.

- For category 3 = severe, the point estimate of the half-life is $t_{1/2}=\frac{\mathrm{ln}2}{0.01223}=56.7$ days.
